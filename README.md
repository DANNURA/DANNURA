Hi there! I'm a passionate and versatile Data Scientist, Web and Software Tester, and Full-Stack Engineer with a strong foundation in building, analyzing, and securing modern web applications. I specialize in developing scalable backend systems, crafting intuitive frontends, and ensuring robust quality through thorough testing.

With hands-on experience across the software development lifecycle—from data exploration and predictive modeling to API design and automated testing—I bring a multi-dimensional perspective to every project I contribute to.

I enjoy solving real-world problems with code, whether through data insights, performance-optimized APIs, or seamless user interfaces. Currently working with Python, JavaScript (React & Node.js), Typescript (NestJS) MongoDB, PostgreSQL, and testing tools like Selenium and Postman.
